## Navigate with Buttons

In the home page i.e login page, we can go to challenge 2 by clicking on 'CONTINUE WITH GOOGLE' and 'CONTINUE WITH FACEBOOK' Buttons. Also if email and password is entered and clicked Sign In, it will navigate to challenge 2 page. 

Similary, there are 2 buttons given in Challenge 2 i.e Video page. From where we can either go back to challenge 1 or go to forward to challenge 3 screen i.e Date Picker. 

In Date Picker as well, we have provided a back button to go back to challenge 2.
